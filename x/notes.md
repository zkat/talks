* peerDependencies
* shrinkwrap
* Teens & Orcs
* npmO
* LTS and work w/ node ("why are we getting different releases of npm w/ node?")

* Tutorial stuff! (stuff on slides they can stuff into a console)
* between 20 and 40 slides
* no bullet points (at least first draft) -- ONE thing per slide
* show thing to raquel
* bring them up to speed with stuff that's new and changed in v3
* focus on framing things as pivots into the future (frontend, windows?)
* frontend modules! assets/! lifecycle scripts!
* es6 modules - it's a cluster, and we're keeping a close eye on it. Ideas? give
* what's coming should be maybe 1/5 of the content.

## Talk structure

### Get an outline done

* Get index cards and write shit on index cards
* words or ideas that capture what's going into the Talk
* put it into a big space that can be seen from afar
* Extract topics, figure out themes, categories
* Spit out a 3-act structure from that
* make a pile that can be a linear read
* turn that into an outline
* move it around until it can be written down
* Write the whole longhand version
* Record myself and watch it
* pay attention to transitions, where repetition happens
* Callbacks (references to prior information) is ok, but should happen
* Very rare that good talk is first draft
* Keep in mind that everyone is gonna be ESL + limited attention span
