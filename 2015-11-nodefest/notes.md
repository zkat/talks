# presentation

* Talk to Rebecca about her talks!!
* Get the initial one ASAP!

## things to touch on

* Make a joke about maru-chan
* npm is, in fact, a company!
* We have a team!
* flat deps/dedupe
* phased install
* peerDependencies
* shrinkwrap
* Teens & Orcs
* npmO
* LTS and work w/ node ("why are we getting different releases of npm w/ node?")

* Tutorial stuff! (stuff on slides they can stuff into a console)
* between 20 and 40 slides
* no bullet points (at least first draft) -- ONE thing per slide
* show thing to raquel
* bring them up to speed with stuff that's new and changed in v3
* focus on framing things as pivots into the future (frontend, windows?)
* frontend modules! assets/! lifecycle scripts!
* es6 modules - it's a cluster, and we're keeping a close eye on it. Ideas? give
* what's coming should be maybe 1/5 of the content.

## Talk structure

### Get an outline done

* Get index cards and write shit on index cards
* words or ideas that capture what's going into the Talk
* put it into a big space that can be seen from afar
* Extract topics, figure out themes, categories
* Spit out a 3-act structure from that
* make a pile that can be a linear read
* turn that into an outline
* move it around until it can be written down
* Write the whole longhand version
* Record myself and watch it
* pay attention to transitions, where repetition happens
* Callbacks (references to prior information) is ok, but should happen
* Very rare that good talk is first draft
* Keep in mind that everyone is gonna be ESL + limited attention span

### Notes

* We've wanted a progress bar for a long time (cute story)
* Explain what a singleton is in more detail
* We made a mistake calling it orgs - organizations!
* WELL ACTUALLY - it's not free for open source yet
* Font size on code samples was tiny
* Even extremely complicated technical terms tend to be fine: colloquialism is what I should stay away from.

* Laurie has diagrams about the module loader!
* didn't describe semver -- a quick primer on semver would be good
* ditto singletons
* said ECMAscript without saying what it is (or what es2015 is)
* Don't use "heavy" for onsite - just say "it's self-hosted"
* not "org user" -- there is simply an org
* Try to make things more conversational like they got later

* Make a note about how I'll talk about 2.x
* The beginning should be tightened up a bit

* Stop banging the table
